****Deck 15****

Deck 15 was made as a proof-of-concept disk-golf puzzle game for Cyan Worlds, Inc.  

Play as the captain of a starship. The vessel has lost power suddenly. 
With guidance from your AI companion, use the spare energy core onboard to power various ship systems on your way to and make your way to engineering to restore power.
You will encounter puzzles and obstacles on your way, including varying gravity and venting gases. Good luck!



****About****

Deck 15 was developed by Eastern Washington University students Andrew Sales (Team lead), Kat Bozhinov, Kaylene Petrin, Max Iniguez for senior project/senior capstone.  Our team had the opportunity to work with Cyan Worlds, Inc. and develop a proof-of-concept game for them.  We were asked to make disk-golf puzzle game using Ue4. The requirements are as follows: Instead of a disk, the game must incorporate a ball and contain goals to throw the ball in.  The game must have at least 3 playable levels, a wind component to effect the flight of the ball, locations where gravity will vary, a throwable ball mechanic.

Initially the game was called “GolfGame” as a placeholder title. We decided the game’s setting would be in a spaceship that suddenly lost power.  The player uses a power core (the ball) to power up rooms in the ship. The player must overcome various obstacles such as varying gravity and wind from fans and steam, trying to get the spare energy core into its storage system(goal), and make their way toward the engine room to restore power to the entire ship.

Developing Deck 15 was a fun and challenging experience.  Our team had little to no experience with C++ and no previous experience with Ue4.  We had to overcome the obstacles that come with game development, along with learning a new language and software.  Over the course of 5 months our team was able to gain a better insight into the software development process and pick up new skills.

****Requirements****

The following are the minimum requirements recommended to run the game:

- Windows 7 64-bit later
- Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster
- NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higher
- 8 GB RAM

****Note****

The code in the source code follows Ue4 coding standards, which slightly vary from traditional coding standards. For example, many of the member variables are unable to be set to private as Ue4 must access certain variables to set them in the Ue4's editor.

Due to the interest of time and the late decision to name the game "Deck 15," all source files remain as the original name: "GolfGame."
